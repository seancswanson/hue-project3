### User Stories

> As a user, I want to be able to create an account to use the color detection service.
> As a user, I want to be able to upload a photo, analyze the colors, and view color schemes based on those colors to develop a website with cohesive design practices.

### Versioning

> As of **January 28, 2018** this app is in development whilst enrolled in General Assembly's WDI program and is initilized in this GitHub repo. NPM init files created, incorporated a MERN Auth Boilerplate. Began stubbing out user flow and routes.

> As of **January 29, 2018**, our group crafted API calls through Axios to fire a backend request to Cloudinary... Determining which results to store to later pass to imagga detection API.

> As of **January 30, 2018**, this app is now returning analyzed prominent colors from the uploaded image and on click will redirect the users to the color picker. Databases are also fleshed out to relate saved colors to a user. Big win!

> As of **January 31, 2018** organized the CSS files to allow for easier targeting of elements in the large collection of components. Rendering a larger color picker, styling nav and footer components, getting things pretty! 

> As of **February 1, 2018** the app has a semi-working delete favorite color function. Fixed some layout bugs involving height of parent components. Created more states to keep track of data across components and pulled functions out to be refactored and passed as props.

> As of **February 2, 2018** the user can now use Facebook to upload an image! Clicking colors calculated from color schemes now redirect cursor on the color picker. User can see instantly the color they just favorited.

> As of **Feb 3, 2018** here lies the MVP in all of its glory. There are now tooltip descriptions of color scheme calculations. 

> As of **February 4, 2018** the code is much cleaner and is constantly being maintained in it's current version by Jade Rosse, Desiree Rainey, and Sean Swanson.
 

## If we had more time I would...

> Fix the functionality for removing favorite colors.

> Convert wireframes to digital file.

> Post Trello flow.
